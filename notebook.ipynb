    "When preparing to venture into a business that the company has no expertise in, making purchases can prove to be daunting. This being the foundational phase of a business, having expert advice significantly increases the chances of having a successful business. However, as much as human knowledge is valuable, it is also subjective and prone to biases. There is pressing need to have a more scientific and evidence-based approach to help starting businesses make informed decisions when making purchases."
